## **Enhancing Your Analytic Workflow with ADK Multi-Agent Systems (E1 \- E15)**

Here are 10 opportunities to leverage Google's ADK for a more robust, flexible, and unbiased analytical workflow, drawing inspiration from your existing ravint22 structure and the ADK documentation \[1, 210\]:

1. **Implement a** QueryRefinementAgent **(LlmAgent with Tools):**

   * **Opportunity**: Before the ResponderAgent generates an initial answer, introduce an LlmAgent dedicated to refining the user's query \[238\]. This aligns with the analytical best practice of clarifying the core question \[316 (PDF p.1)\].  
   * **ADK Leverage**: This agent could use tools \[105\] like a QuestionClassifierTool (custom function tool) to identify ambiguity or embedded assumptions in the initial query. It could also use a tool to check for overly broad or narrow scope.  
   * **Benefit**: Ensures the entire downstream process works on a well-defined, unbiased question, improving accuracy and relevance of the initialAnswer and subsequent analyses \[316 (PDF p.1)\].  
   * **Workflow Integration**: This agent would be the first in the sequence, its output (a refined query) feeding into the ResponderAgent.  
2. **Introduce a** BiasDetectionAgent **(LlmAgent with specific instructions):**

   * **Opportunity**: After the initialAnswer is generated, insert a specialized LlmAgent tasked with identifying potential cognitive biases in the initialAnswer itself and in the supporting research \[316 (PDF p.10)\].  
   * **ADK Leverage**: This agent's instruction \[238\] would be heavily prompted with definitions and examples of common cognitive biases (e.g., confirmation bias, availability heuristic). It wouldn't necessarily need complex tools but would rely on detailed instructions and the LLM's reasoning.  
   * **Benefit**: Explicitly addresses and flags potential biases early, allowing subsequent agents (like the CritiqueAgent or SynthesisAgent) to consider these flagged biases, leading to a more objective finalSummary \[316 (PDF p.10)\].  
   * **Workflow Integration**: Could run in parallel with the AnalyzeAssumptionsAgent or sequentially after it. Its output (list of potential biases and explanations) would feed into the CritiqueAgent and SynthesisAgent.  
3. **Employ a** DynamicRoutingCoordinatorAgent **(LlmAgent with AgentTool):**

   * **Opportunity**: Instead of a purely sequential Promise.all for the initial analytical tasks (assumptions, research, counter-evidence, premortem, info gaps), consider an LlmAgent that dynamically decides which of these specialist agents to call, or in what order, based on the initialAnswerText.  
   * **ADK Leverage**: This CoordinatorAgent \[88\] could use AgentTool \[82, 309 (PDF p.9)\] to invoke the specialist agents. Its instruction would guide it on how to prioritize or sequence these analytical tasks based on the nature of the initialAnswerText. For instance, if the answer is highly speculative, it might prioritize AnalyzeAssumptionsAgent and InformationGapAgent first.  
   * **Benefit**: Adds flexibility and efficiency by tailoring the analytical process to the specific characteristics of the problem at hand, potentially saving resources if certain analyses are not always needed.  
   * **Workflow Integration**: Would replace the current Promise.all block for these specific agents in orchestrateQueryFlow.  
4. **Utilize a** LoopAgent **for Iterative Refinement of the Initial Answer:**

   * **Opportunity**: Implement an iterative refinement loop for the initialAnswer before it undergoes the full suite of analyses \[48, 251\]. This loop could involve a GeneratorAgent (like your current ResponderAgent) and a QuickCritiqueAgent.  
   * **ADK Leverage**: A LoopAgent \[48, 251\] would orchestrate this. The GeneratorAgent produces an answer, the QuickCritiqueAgent provides immediate feedback, and the GeneratorAgent refines the answer. The loop continues until max\_iterations is reached or the QuickCritiqueAgent signals satisfaction (e.g., by returning an event with escalate=True) \[49\]. State is managed via session.state \[74, 273\].  
   * **Benefit**: Improves the quality of the initialAnswer early on, potentially reducing the workload or the severity of issues identified by later, more intensive analytical agents.  
   * **Workflow Integration**: This LoopAgent would wrap the ResponderAgent and a new QuickCritiqueAgent, running before the main parallel analysis phase.  
5. **Decompose** ResearcherAgent **and** CounterEvidenceResearcherAgent **using** ParallelAgent**:**

   * **Opportunity**: If researching supporting and counter-evidence involves querying multiple distinct sources or using different methodologies, these agents could be WorkflowAgents themselves, specifically ParallelAgents \[41, 255\].  
   * **ADK Leverage**: The main ResearcherAgent could be a ParallelAgent that fans out requests to sub-agents, each specialized in a particular data source (e.g., AcademicSearchAgent, NewsSearchAgent, InternalDocsSearchAgent) \[46, 255\]. Each sub-agent would use a Google Search tool \[123\] or custom tools for specific databases. Results would be written to session.state \[74\] with distinct keys for later aggregation.  
   * **Benefit**: Speeds up the evidence-gathering process and allows for more specialized (and potentially more effective) search strategies for different types of evidence.  
   * **Workflow Integration**: The ResearchEvidenceOutputSchema and ResearchCounterEvidenceOutputSchema would then be aggregations of outputs from these parallel sub-agents.  
6. **Implement a "Red Teaming" or "Devil's Advocacy" Loop using** LoopAgent **and** AgentTool**:**

   * **Opportunity**: Your DevilsAdvocateAgent (challenge function) currently runs once. For critical analyses, this could be an iterative process where challenges are generated, the main argument is refined to address them, and then new challenges are posed to the refined argument.  
   * **ADK Leverage**: A LoopAgent \[48, 251\] could manage this. One sub-agent refines the core argument/answer (perhaps a modified ResponderAgent or the SynthesisAgent focusing only on the answer). Another sub-agent is your DevilsAdvocateAgent (invoked via AgentTool \[82, 309 (PDF p.9)\]). The loop continues until the challenges become weak or a set number of iterations is complete. Shared session state \[74\] would hold the evolving argument and challenges.  
   * **Benefit**: Creates a more robust and stress-tested final analysis by systematically trying to find flaws.  
   * **Workflow Integration**: This could be an optional, deeper analysis phase triggered by certain conditions or user request, likely before the final SynthesisAgent run.  
7. **Introduce a** ConfidenceScoringAgent **(LlmAgent or CustomAgent):**

   * **Opportunity**: While your SynthesisAgent includes a confidence field, the scoring could be more explicit and auditable by dedicating an agent to it.  
   * **ADK Leverage**: This could be an LlmAgent instructed to evaluate all inputs (initial answer, evidence, critique, etc.) and assign a confidence score with a detailed rationale, or a CustomAgent \[54, 259\] implementing a specific scoring rubric (e.g., based on evidence quality, number of unmitigated risks, severity of information gaps).  
   * **Benefit**: Provides a more transparent and potentially more objective basis for the confidence level in the final synthesis. The rationale becomes part of the auditable analytical trail.  
   * **Workflow Integration**: This agent would run before the SynthesisAgent, and its output (score and rationale) would be a direct input to the SynthesisAgent.  
8. **Use** before\_tool\_callback **and** after\_tool\_callback **for Enhanced Tool Use Auditing & Control:**

   * **Opportunity**: For tools used by agents like ResearcherAgent (e.g., external search APIs), add callbacks for finer-grained logging, input validation, or even result modification/caching.  
   * **ADK Leverage**: Implement before\_tool\_callback \[367\] to log the exact queries being sent to external tools or to validate/sanitize inputs. Implement after\_tool\_callback \[367\] to log the raw results, check for errors, or even to cache results to avoid redundant API calls for identical queries within a short timeframe. These callbacks receive ToolContext \[127, 410\] allowing state interaction.  
   * **Benefit**: Increases robustness by catching potential tool-use errors, improves transparency by logging interactions, and can enhance efficiency with caching.  
   * **Workflow Integration**: These callbacks would be registered on the LlmAgents that use tools (e.g., ResearcherAgent, CounterEvidenceResearcherAgent).  
9. **Structured Evaluation with ADK's Evaluation Capabilities:**

   * **Opportunity**: Systematically evaluate the performance of your entire multi-agent workflow and individual agents against predefined test cases \[14, 419\].  
   * **ADK Leverage**: Use ADK's built-in evaluation tools by creating evaluation.test.json files \[165, 419\]. Define eval cases with user queries, expected intermediate tool uses, expected intermediate agent responses, and expected final responses \[419, 420\]. AgentEvaluator.evaluate() can then be used to run these tests programmatically \[166, 420\].  
   * **Benefit**: Ensures analytical rigor, helps detect regressions when updating agent instructions or models, and provides a quantitative way to measure improvements in accuracy, bias reduction, and clarity over time \[419\].  
   * **Workflow Integration**: This is part of the development and CI/CD pipeline rather than runtime, but crucial for robustness.  
10. **Human-in-the-Loop (**HITL**) Agent for Critical Junctures:**

    * **Opportunity**: For highly sensitive analyses or when ambiguity is very high, incorporate a step where a human expert can review intermediate findings and provide guidance or validate assumptions.  
    * **ADK Leverage**: Implement a HumanReviewTool (a custom FunctionTool \[115, 302\]) that, when called, pauses the agent workflow and sends the relevant data (e.g., current synthesis draft, key uncertainties) to an external system for human review (e.g., a task queue, email) \[94, 280\]. The tool would then wait for the human's input before returning it to the agent flow. This can be orchestrated by an LlmAgent instructed to call this tool when, for example, the InformationGapAgent identifies high-impact gaps or the ConfidenceScoringAgent returns a very low score.  
    * **Benefit**: Combines AI's analytical breadth with human expert depth and judgment, critical for ensuring accuracy and mitigating risks in complex or high-stakes decisions \[94\].  
    * **Workflow Integration**: Could be a conditional step within the orchestrateQueryFlow, possibly before the SynthesisAgent, triggered by specific outputs from other agents. The ToolContext \[127\] could be used to manage the state of the human review task.  
        
        
11. DynamicToolSelectionAgent **(LlmAgent with Toolsets for Researchers):**

    * **Rationale**: Your ResearcherAgent and CounterEvidenceResearcherAgent are pivotal. Making their tool usage dynamic via Toolsets \[143, 300 (PDF p.10)\] (e.g., MCPToolset \[148, 328\] for databases, VertexAiSearchTool \[316\], Google Search \[123, 313\]) greatly enhances flexibility and the ability to tap into the best data source for any given claim.  
    * **ADK Leverage**: LlmAgent \[27, 238\] acting as a mini-orchestrator for research, BaseToolset \[143, 300 (PDF p.10)\], MCPToolset \[148, 328\].  
    * **Benefit**: Optimizes evidence gathering for quality and relevance, leading to more accurate analysis.  
12. EvidenceConflictResolutionAgent **(LlmAgent):**

    * **Rationale**: Directly addressing conflicting evidence is a sophisticated analytical step that goes beyond merely listing counter-evidence. This specialized agent can add significant nuance.  
    * **ADK Leverage**: LlmAgent \[27, 238\] with focused instruction \[164, 238\] to analyze pairs or sets of conflicting LocalEvidenceSchema items from session.state \[74, 273\].  
    * **Benefit**: Helps the SynthesisAgent to more intelligently integrate or account for contradictions, improving accuracy and reducing the chance of a biased interpretation based on which piece of evidence is simply "louder."  
13. SensitivityAnalysisAgent **(CustomAgent or LlmAgent with Tools):**

    * **Rationale**: Understanding how robust conclusions are to changes in underlying assumptions or key evidence is critical for assessing confidence and providing caveats. This is a core technique for robust analysis.  
    * **ADK Leverage**: Could be an LlmAgent \[27, 238\] that re-runs a simplified version of the core reasoning if an assumption (from KeyAssumptionsCheckAgent) is flipped. More robustly, a CustomAgent \[54, 259\] could orchestrate targeted re-evaluations by other agents based on modified inputs stored in session.state \[74, 273\].  
    * **Benefit**: Adds depth to the finalSummary by explicitly stating how stable the conclusions are, improving clarity on the analysis's limitations.  
14. MultiModelSynthesisAgent **(ParallelAgent or SequentialAgent with different LLMs):**

    * **Rationale**: The final synthesis is a critical step. Relying on multiple LLMs or multiple instructed LlmAgents \[27, 238\] to draft this can mitigate the risk of a single model's inherent biases or blind spots significantly influencing the outcome.  
    * **ADK Leverage**: A ParallelAgent \[41, 255\] whose sub\_agents \[69\] are LlmAgents, each configured with a different model (via LiteLLM \[212, 285\] or different model endpoints) or distinct synthesizing instructions. A final "MetaSynthesisAgent" (another LlmAgent) then reviews these parallel drafts from session.state \[74, 273\] to produce the ultimate SynthesisAgentOutput.  
    * **Benefit**: Enhances objectivity and robustness of the finalSummary by incorporating diverse "perspectives" at the synthesis stage.  
15. ErrorHandlingAndRecoveryCoordinator **(CustomAgent or enhanced Orchestrator logic):**

    * **Rationale**: Your current orchestrator has a callAgent helper with try-catch, but a dedicated component or more sophisticated logic within the orchestrator can improve systemic robustness.  
    * **ADK Leverage**: Enhance your orchestrateQueryFlow or wrap it with a CustomAgent \[54, 259\]. This coordinator would not only call agents but inspect their outputs (from session.state \[74, 273\]) for your default...Output values or other error indicators. Based on check\_previous\_result patterns, it could trigger retries with different parameters, call a backup agent, or escalate to a HumanReviewTool if critical failures occur. ADK's error handling patterns (like designing for failure \[1\]) are key here.  
    * **Benefit**: Significantly increases the overall workflow's reliability and resilience, ensuring that partial failures don't necessarily derail the entire analysis.

## **Potential Issues & ADK-Based Fixes for finalSynthesis (F1 \- F10)**

## 

1. **Issue: Bias Propagation from Upstream Agents**

   * **Reason**: If the initialAnswer, research, critique, or any other input to the SynthesisAgent is biased or inaccurate, the SynthesisAgent (being an LLM) might incorporate and amplify these flaws without sufficient critical distance. The synthesis prompt instructs the LLM to integrate findings, but it might not inherently cross-verify or de-bias them sufficiently.  
   * **ADK Patch/Fix**:  
     * **Implement a** BiasCrossReferencingAgent **(LlmAgent)**: Before the SynthesisAgent, this agent would specifically take outputs from the BiasDetectionAgent (suggested previously) and compare them against other inputs like critique and counterEvidence. Its instruction \[164, 238\] would be to flag any unaddressed biases or points where the initial answer seems to contradict the bias report.  
     * **Strengthen** CritiqueAgent **Instructions**: Ensure the CritiqueAgent (in critic-agent.ts) is explicitly prompted to identify and highlight biases present in the initialAnswer and evidence. Your current prompt asks it to identify "potential biases or oversimplifications," which is good, but adding more weight or specific techniques (e.g., "consider if anchoring bias is present given the initial framing") could help.  
     * **ADK** Multi-Agent System Pattern **(Review/Critique)**: The overall workflow acts as a Review/Critique pattern \[93, 279\], but ensuring each agent is aware of and actively looking for biases passed from others strengthens this.  
2. **Issue: Over-Reliance on the** initialAnswer **(Anchoring Bias)**

   * **Reason**: The synthesisAgentPrompt presents the initialAnswer first. The LLM performing the synthesis might anchor heavily on this initial piece of information, giving less weight to subsequent critiques, counter-evidence, or challenges, even if they are strong.  
   * **ADK Patch/Fix**:  
     * ArgumentReconstructionAgent **(LlmAgent or SequentialAgent)**: Instead of feeding the raw initialAnswer directly to the SynthesisAgent, first have an agent deconstruct it and then reconstruct a "balanced brief." This agent would take the initialAnswer, critique, challenges, and counterEvidence and generate a *neutral summary of the state of the argument* before synthesis.  
     * **ADK Leverage**: This could be an LlmAgent \[27, 238\] prompted for neutrality, or a SequentialAgent \[36, 248\] that first summarizes the initialAnswer, then the counterEvidence, then the critique into separate fields in session.state \[74, 273\]. The SynthesisAgent prompt would then be restructured to work from this balanced brief.  
     * **Prompt Engineering**: Modify the synthesisAgentPrompt to explicitly instruct the LLM to give equal or even weighted consideration to challenging information (e.g., "Critically evaluate the initial answer in light of the counter-evidence and critique before summarizing strengths.").  
3. **Issue: Insufficient Integration of Counter-Evidence and Challenges**

   * **Reason**: While your SynthesisAgentInputSchema includes counterEvidence and challenges, the LLM might only superficially acknowledge them (e.g., list them in keyWeaknesses or remainingUncertainties) without truly grappling with their implications for the summary and confidence.  
   * **ADK Patch/Fix**:  
     * **Dedicated** CounterArgumentIntegrationAgent **(LlmAgent)**: This agent runs before the SynthesisAgent. It takes the initialAnswer (or the balanced brief from point 2\) and specifically the counterEvidence and challenges. Its sole task is to generate a revised version of the answer/brief that *explicitly incorporates or refutes* these counterarguments.  
     * **ADK Leverage**: LlmAgent \[27, 238\] with a very focused instruction \[164, 238\]. The output (a "challenged" or "pressure-tested" answer) then feeds into the SynthesisAgent.  
     * **Refine** SynthesisAgentOutputSchema: Add a field like howCounterEvidenceWasAddressed: z.array(z.string()) to force the SynthesisAgent to articulate this.  
4. **Issue: Uneven Quality or Depth of Input Analyses**

   * **Reason**: Some analytical agents in your orchestrator-agent.ts might produce more thorough or higher-quality outputs than others due to variations in their LLM, prompting, or the complexity of their task. The SynthesisAgent might not be able to discern this quality difference and could give undue weight to a poorly reasoned input.  
   * **ADK Patch/Fix**:  
     * QualityCheckAgent **(LlmAgent or CustomAgent with Callbacks)**: Introduce an agent (or use callbacks on existing agents) to score the quality/confidence of each upstream agent's output before it reaches the SynthesisAgent. For example, after the CritiqueAgent runs, a QualityCheckAgent could assess if the critique is specific, actionable, and well-supported.  
     * **ADK Leverage**: This could be an LlmAgent \[27, 238\] or a CustomAgent \[54, 259\] that uses after\_agent\_callback \[367\] on other agents. The quality scores (saved to session.state \[74, 273\]) are then passed to the SynthesisAgent, which can be instructed to weigh inputs accordingly.  
     * **ADK** Built-in Evaluation: Regularly use ADK's evaluation capabilities \[14, 419\] (AgentEvaluator.evaluate() \[166, 420\]) for each specialized agent to ensure they meet quality standards.  
5. **Issue: LLM Hallucination or Factual Inaccuracies in Synthesis**

   * **Reason**: The SynthesisAgent's LLM, in the process of summarizing and integrating, might introduce new information not present in its inputs or misrepresent facts from its inputs. This is a general risk with LLMs.  
   * **ADK Patch/Fix**:  
     * FactVerificationAgent **(LlmAgent with Tools)**: After the SynthesisAgent produces a draft, this agent specifically extracts key factual claims from the draft summary and actionableRecommendations. It then uses tools (like Google Search \[123, 313\] or targeted API calls via FunctionTool \[115, 302\]) to verify these claims against external sources or the original evidence base (loaded from session.state \[74, 273\]).  
     * **ADK** LoopAgent **for Correction**: If inaccuracies are found, the output of the FactVerificationAgent could trigger a LoopAgent \[48, 251\] that sends the draft synthesis and the identified errors back to the SynthesisAgent (or a specialized CorrectionAgent) for revision. The loop continues until verification passes or max iterations are hit.  
6. **Issue: Failure to Fully Address High-Impact Information Gaps or Assumptions**

   * **Reason**: The SynthesisAgent might list informationGaps and assumptions (via remainingUncertainties and keyWeaknesses) but fail to adequately convey their *impact* on the confidence and actionableRecommendations.  
   * **ADK Patch/Fix**:  
     * ImpactAssessmentAgent **(LlmAgent)**: Before the SynthesisAgent, this agent takes the outputs from InformationGapAgent (especially high-impact gaps) and AnalyzeAssumptionsAgent (especially high-risk assumptions). It then explicitly describes the potential consequences for the overall analysis if these gaps remain unfilled or assumptions prove false.  
     * **ADK Leverage**: LlmAgent \[27, 238\]. This impact assessment (textual output) is then a mandatory input to the SynthesisAgent, which would be prompted to reflect it in its confidence rationale and summary.  
     * **Structured Input for Synthesis**: Ensure SynthesisAgentInputSchema explicitly takes these impact assessments.  
7. **Issue: Cognitive Biases of the Synthesis LLM Itself**

   * **Reason**: The LLM powering synthesisAgentInternalFlow has its own inherent training biases which can influence how it integrates information, what it emphasizes, and what it omits, regardless of the input quality.  
   * **ADK Patch/Fix**:  
     * Multi-PerspectiveSynthesisTechnique **(ParallelAgent with multiple LlmAgents)**: Instead of one SynthesisAgent, use a ParallelAgent \[41, 255\] to run multiple LlmAgent instances for synthesis. Each instance could use a slightly different LLM (if using LiteLLM \[212, 285\] or different model versions) or, more easily, the same LLM but with critically different instruction prompts (e.g., one emphasizing a "most likely" outcome, another a "worst-case" outcome, another a "most optimistic but plausible" outcome).  
     * MetaSynthesisAgent **(LlmAgent)**: A final LlmAgent then takes these diverse syntheses from session.state \[74, 273\] and creates a final, blended finalSummary that acknowledges the different perspectives, or selects the most robust one based on predefined criteria.  
     * **Benefit**: This is a form of "Analysis of Competing Syntheses" and reduces reliance on a single LLM's potential quirks.  
8. **Issue: Oversimplification or Loss of Nuance in Aggregation**

   * **Reason**: The process of creating a summary, keyStrengths, and keyWeaknesses can lead to oversimplification of complex, nuanced findings from the various analytical inputs. The LLM might choose the most salient points but miss subtle yet important details.  
   * **ADK Patch/Fix**:  
     * NuancePreservationCheckAgent **(LlmAgent)**: After a draft synthesis is produced, this agent compares the draft summary, keyStrengths, and keyWeaknesses against the detailed outputs of the upstream agents (e.g., full critique text, lists of assumptions with their risks). It is prompted to identify if any critical nuances, caveats, or high-impact details (e.g., a "High" risk assumption) were lost or underrepresented.  
     * **ADK Leverage**: LlmAgent \[27, 238\]. Its findings could trigger a refinement loop for the SynthesisAgent.  
     * **Structured Logging/Artifacts**: Ensure that the full, detailed outputs of all upstream agents are saved as Artifacts \[393\] using context.save\_artifact \[394 (PDF p.5)\], making them available for such detailed cross-checking.  
9. **Issue: Lack of True Adversarial Challenge at the Synthesis Stage**

   * **Reason**: While the DevilsAdvocateAgent challenges the initialAnswer, the *synthesis process itself* might not be adequately challenged. The SynthesisAgent aims to integrate, which might lead to a less critical stance on the combined inputs.  
   * **ADK Patch/Fix**:  
     * SynthesisCritiqueAgent **(LlmAgent)**: After the SynthesisAgent produces its output (SynthesisAgentOutputSchema), this new agent acts like your existing CritiqueAgent but specifically targets the *synthesized output*. It would look for logical flaws in how the inputs were integrated, remaining inconsistencies, or if the synthesis overstated confidence.  
     * **ADK Leverage**: LlmAgent \[27, 238\]. This follows the Review/Critique MAS pattern \[93, 279\]. The output could even feed into a LoopAgent \[48, 251\] for iterative refinement of the synthesis itself.  
10. **Issue: "Default Output" Contamination or Insufficient Error Handling**

    * **Reason**: Your orchestrator-agent.ts has default output values (defaultRespondOutput, etc.) if an agent fails. If several agents return default (failure) outputs, and the SynthesisAgent isn't explicitly instructed on how to handle widespread failures, it might still try to synthesize from these defaults, leading to a nonsensical or misleading finalSummary. The current finalSummary in case of errors is a bit generic.  
    * **ADK Patch/Fix**:  
      * **Enhanced Orchestrator Error Aggregation**: The orchestrator-agent.ts should more explicitly aggregate the errorsEncounteredInfo. This structured error report should be a distinct input to the SynthesisAgent.  
      * **Modified** SynthesisAgent **Prompting for Failure States**: The synthesisAgentPrompt needs clearer instructions on how to behave if a significant number of its inputs are default/error values. It should explicitly state that a comprehensive synthesis isn't possible and detail *which* analyses failed and why this impacts confidence.  
      * **ADK** ErrorHandlingAndRecoveryAgent **(CustomAgent \- as previously suggested)**: This agent would be even better, as it could preemptively manage failures before they even reach the SynthesisAgent, potentially invoking simpler fallback analyses or clearly flagging the degradation in the analytical product. ADK's design for failure (e.g. check\_previous\_result, recover\_from\_error for tools) \[1\] can be conceptually applied to agent outputs in a custom coordinator.

By implementing these ADK-based solutions, you can systematically address these potential pitfalls, making your finalSynthesis significantly more robust, unbiased, and accurate.
